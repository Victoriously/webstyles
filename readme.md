## Update: April 2015

I started this project nearly a year ago. I use it in some form on every client project to communicate my ideas and plans for a website. I originally used a CSS framework, and the code became bloated.

## About Web Styles

This simple HTML & CSS template is inspired by Samantha Warren's [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/). Style Tiles open up the conversation about design without designing a a website in Photoshop. 

I loved the *idea* behind Style Tiles: a simple way to share early design ideas with clients. However, when I tried to mock up some design ideas using the Style Tiles template, I was frustrated. 

I'm a web designer and going into Photoshop to change a colour's HEX code felt wrong. And what about typography? If you work on the web, you know that type varies between Photoshop and the browser. (*Even with Typekit Sync!*)

So, I created this template. My **Web Styles** template is nothing fancy but it allows you to create colour palettes using old fashioned HTML & CSS (or SASS), try out type options and more. 

### What You Can Do with Web Styles 

1. Quickly enter hexcodes to experiment with colours for a design
- Test out different fonts for your project's copy
- Compare different typefaces and share with your client - in the browser.
- Easily switch to a different font or colour using the included variables. 
- Begin building a style guide *while* you develop your initial design.
